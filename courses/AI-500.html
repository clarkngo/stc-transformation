        <h1>AI 500: Artificial Intelligence Overview - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Provides a broad foundation in AI, covering history, major sub-fields, core concepts, and ethical implications.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: AI Deployment Ethics for a Local Business</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A small local restaurant chain wants to implement an AI-powered system for predicting customer demand and optimizing staff scheduling. As a newly hired AI consultant, prepare a <strong>short executive summary (non-technical, 2-page max) and a 3-minute explanatory video</strong> for the restaurant owner. Your submission must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify 2-3 specific AI technologies (e.g., ML for prediction, NLP for customer reviews) that could be used.</li>
                <li>Outline the potential benefits and specific ethical concerns (e.g., worker surveillance, bias in prediction) relevant to a local business in your community.</li>
                <li>Propose a phased implementation plan, highlighting initial data requirements and expected challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires synthesizing broad AI knowledge with a specific, local, and ethical context, presented in multi-modal formats. An AI can summarize AI, but not apply it effectively to a unique, hypothetical local business context with specific ethical considerations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You mentioned worker surveillance as an ethical concern. How would a foundational concept like 'model interpretability' help mitigate this specific issue in your proposed system?"</li>
                <li>"In your video, you suggested using NLP for customer reviews. What are the top two **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** a junior data analyst would need to collect and preprocess that text data effectively?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in drafting the initial executive summary, and what part of its output did you need to critically adapt for a non-technical restaurant owner?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: AI Landscape Analysis & Presentation (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Emerging AI Trends & Societal Impact</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is an advisory panel for a non-profit organization focused on technology's societal impact. Select an emerging AI sub-field (e.g., Quantum AI, Explainable AI, Federated Learning, Causal AI â€“ *must be approved by instructor*). Develop a comprehensive <strong>AI Landscape Analysis Report & Presentation Portfolio</strong> including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase 1: Research Proposal & Stakeholder Analysis:</strong> Outline the chosen AI field, its core technical principles, and identify key societal stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, industry, public).</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2: Trend Analysis & Ethical Framework:</strong> Analyze current trends, forecast short/long-term impacts, and apply an existing ethical AI framework to identify risks and opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3: Public Awareness Campaign & Reflection:</strong> Create a mock public awareness campaign (e.g., social media strategy, short explainer video storyboard) and individual reflections on team dynamics and AI tool usage in research.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires in-depth research into an emerging, often nuanced, field, synthesis of ethical considerations with societal impact, and creative design for a specific audience. While AI can assist with research and drafting, the critical analysis, synthesis, and creative application to a specific non-profit's goals are human-driven.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your team analyzed Explainable AI. Can you articulate a specific scenario where 'black box' AI, despite its performance, would be ethically unacceptable, referencing a core concept from your report?"</li>
                <li>"Walk me through a disagreement your team had on the ethical implications of your chosen AI trend. How did your team use **AI Agents** or structured debate to resolve it?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: AI Concept Demonstrator</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Implement a small Python program that visually demonstrates a core AI concept discussed in class (e.g., a simple Perceptron learning XOR, A* search pathfinding visualization, K-Means clustering). Your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use **AI Agents** to assist in writing the visualization code and core algorithm implementation.</li>
                <li>Submit the functioning code.</li>
                <li>Submit a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** (3-5 prompts) detailing how you iterated with the AI, what challenges you faced, and how you critically evaluated its suggestions for accuracy and efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on the student's ability to conceptualize the visual demonstration, critically apply AI-generated code to a specific educational purpose, and reflect on the debugging/refinement process. An AI can code, but the pedagogical intent and critical evaluation are human.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a specific instance where the AI's initial code for your visualization was incorrect or inefficient, and how your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** helped you identify and fix it."</li>
                <li>"What prompt structure did you find most effective when asking the AI to generate a visualization component?"</li>
            </ul>
