        <h1>AI 510: Artificial Intelligence in Cloud Computing - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Explores deploying, managing, and scaling AI solutions using major cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). Covers serverless functions, containerization, and managed AI services.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Cloud AI Strategy for a Startup</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A nascent startup, "GreenThumb AI," aims to provide drone-based agricultural insights using computer vision models trained on satellite imagery. They have limited budget but anticipate rapid growth. As their lead cloud architect, prepare a <strong>cloud infrastructure proposal (5-page max) and a cost-analysis spreadsheet</strong> for a specific major cloud provider (e.g., AWS). Your proposal must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recommend specific cloud services for data ingestion (e.g., S3, Data Lake), model training (e.g., SageMaker, Vertex AI), and inference deployment (e.g., Lambda, AKS).</li>
                <li>Justify your choices based on cost-efficiency, scalability, and ease of management for a small team.</li>
                <li>Outline key security considerations and compliance requirements for agricultural data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires applying broad cloud and AI knowledge to a specific startup's constraints (budget, growth, data type) on a named platform. While AI can list services, selecting and justifying them for a nuanced scenario, along with a detailed cost analysis, demands human expertise.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You chose AWS SageMaker for model training. What specific **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** would a data scientist need to containerize their custom training script for SageMaker?"</li>
                <li>"Explain a potential bottleneck in your proposed architecture if GreenThumb AI scales to process data from 10,000 drones simultaneously, and how you would re-architect for that scale."</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in drafting the initial proposal outline, and what specific technical details did you have to critically verify from its output?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Cloud AI Deployment Pipeline (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Automated AI Model Deployment</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is tasked with building a fully automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for an existing machine learning model (provided). The pipeline should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatically retrain the model on new data (simulated hourly/daily updates) in the cloud.</li>
                <li>Evaluate its performance (using provided metrics script).</li>
                <li>Deploy a new version to a cloud endpoint only if performance improves, with rollback capability.</li>
                <li>Trigger alerts for pipeline failures or performance degradation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your <strong>Project Portfolio</strong> must include the functional pipeline, comprehensive documentation (including **architecture diagrams**), and individual reflections on challenges and **AI Agent** usage.</p>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires hands-on integration of multiple cloud services, CI/CD tools, and ML operations (MLOps) principles. AI can generate code snippets, but building, integrating, debugging, and documenting a complete, functional automated pipeline for a specific cloud platform is a complex engineering task.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your pipeline used [Specific Cloud CI/CD Service]. What was the most challenging aspect of integrating the model retraining step with this service, and how did your team overcome it?"</li>
                <li>"If the model performance dropped significantly after a new deployment, what debugging steps, using your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)**, would you take immediately to diagnose the issue?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Serverless AI Inference Endpoint</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Given a pre-trained small AI model (e.g., for image classification or text sentiment), deploy it as a serverless inference endpoint on a chosen cloud platform (e.g., AWS Lambda + API Gateway, Azure Functions). Your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement the serverless function to load and execute the model.</li>
                <li>Configure the API endpoint for invocation.</li>
                <li>Submit the code, deployment configuration files, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to generate deployment scripts, YAML configurations, and Python code, along with your critical evaluation of their accuracy and suitability for the cloud environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on practical cloud deployment skills, critical evaluation of AI-generated configurations (which are often subtly incorrect or incomplete for specific cloud environments), and debugging the integration between different cloud services. The human must understand the nuances of the cloud provider's ecosystem.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a challenge you faced when using an **AI Agent** to generate a specific cloud configuration (e.g., IAM roles, API Gateway proxy setup), and how your understanding of cloud **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** helped you correct it."</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you use to generate the initial serverless function code, and how did you refine it after the first attempt failed?"</li>
            </ul>
