        <h1>AI 520: Natural Language Processing for Artificial Intelligence - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Covers fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including text representation, language models, sentiment analysis, and transformer architectures.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Bias Detection in Online Reviews</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A popular local online review platform for restaurants has received complaints about potential gender or racial bias in its user-generated content. As an NLP specialist, design an approach to detect and quantify such biases. Prepare a <strong>technical report (5-page max) and a mock presentation (slides only)</strong> outlining:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The specific NLP techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling, word embeddings) you would use for detection.</li>
                <li>How you would define and measure 'bias' computationally in this context, citing relevant research papers.</li>
                <li>The ethical challenges of deploying such a system and proposed mitigation strategies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires deep understanding of NLP techniques, critical thinking about complex ethical definitions (e.g., "bias"), and application to a specific, nuanced real-world problem. While AI can summarize NLP concepts, it cannot design a robust, ethical solution for a hypothetical, specific platform and defend its choices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You proposed using [Specific NLP Technique]. Can you explain a scenario where its results might be misleading in detecting subtle bias, and how you would apply your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** to validate the findings qualitatively?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in drafting the initial technical report on bias detection, and what specific NLP-related details did you have to critically verify from its output?"</li>
                <li>"Beyond detection, what are the ethical implications of *intervening* to correct bias in user-generated text, and what NLP methods could be used for such an intervention?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Custom Chatbot Development (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Community Support Chatbot</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is tasked with developing a functional chatbot for a local non-profit (e.g., a food bank, a community health clinic) to answer frequently asked questions and direct users to appropriate resources. The chatbot should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilize a chosen NLP framework (e.g., Rasa, NLTK, Hugging Face transformers).</li>
                <li>Handle at least 5 distinct user intents (e.g., "what are your hours?", "how to volunteer?").</li>
                <li>Integrate with a simple knowledge base (provided).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your <strong>Project Portfolio</strong> must include the functional chatbot, detailed **architecture diagrams** explaining the NLP pipeline, the training data used, and individual reflections on challenges and **AI Agent** usage in development.</p>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires the practical application of NLP principles to build a functional system for a specific domain. While AI can generate code snippets, building, training, debugging, and documenting a custom chatbot that handles specific intents and integrates with a knowledge base demands significant human effort and understanding.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your chatbot used [Specific NLP Framework]. What was the most challenging aspect of training it to recognize a specific user intent, and how did your team apply **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** to improve its accuracy?"</li>
                <li>"Explain the trade-offs your team considered between using a rule-based approach versus a machine learning approach for a particular intent."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Fine-tuning a Pre-trained Language Model (LLM)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Given a pre-trained small language model (e.g., a BERT variant from Hugging Face) and a specific, niche dataset (e.g., legal document classification, medical abstract summarization), fine-tune the model for a new task. Your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement the fine-tuning process.</li>
                <li>Evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.</li>
                <li>Submit the code, performance metrics, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to generate fine-tuning scripts, data preprocessing steps, and evaluation code. Include your critical evaluation of the AI's suggestions and any debugging you performed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on practical NLP model adaptation, critical evaluation of AI-generated code for specific datasets, and debugging the intricate process of fine-tuning, which often requires significant human intervention and understanding of the model's behavior.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a specific instance where an **AI Agent's** suggestion for data preprocessing led to a negative impact on your model's performance, and how your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** helped you identify the problem."</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you use to generate the initial fine-tuning script, and how did you refine it after the first attempt to improve performance?"</li>
