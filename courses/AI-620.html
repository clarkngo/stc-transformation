        <h1>AI 620: Emerging Topics in Artificial Intelligence - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Explores cutting-edge research and rapidly evolving areas within AI, such as Generative AI, Causal AI, Explainable AI (XAI), and neuromorphic computing. Focuses on critical analysis of recent advancements.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Ethical Framework for Generative AI in Creative Industries</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A major Hollywood studio is grappling with the ethical and legal implications of using Generative AI (e.g., for scriptwriting, synthetic actors, music composition) in its productions. As an AI Ethics consultant, prepare a <strong>comprehensive white paper (10-12 pages) and an annotated bibliography of 10+ recent research papers</strong> (within the last 18 months). Your paper must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze the technical capabilities and limitations of specific Generative AI models relevant to the creative arts.</li>
                <li>Propose a legal and ethical framework for responsible deployment, addressing issues like intellectual property, creator rights, and deepfakes.</li>
                <li>Critically evaluate at least three recent research papers that support or challenge your proposed framework.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires in-depth research into rapidly evolving, highly nuanced topics with significant ethical and legal grey areas. While AI can summarize papers, the critical synthesis, proposing a novel framework, and deeply analyzing recent research for its relevance to a specific, high-stakes industry demands human expert judgment and **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in research methodology.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You cited Research Paper A as a key support. Can you explain a specific methodological limitation of that paper that might weaken its applicability to the Hollywood context?"</li>
                <li>"Your framework addresses intellectual property. How would a core concept from **AI 500: AI Overview** (e.g., data privacy) directly intersect with this legal challenge?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in exploring different legal precedents or ethical frameworks for Generative AI, and what part of its output (e.g., case law summaries) did you need to critically verify for accuracy and relevance?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Prototype & Analysis of an Emerging AI Technique (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Explainable AI for Medical Diagnosis</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team will select a specific, cutting-edge **Explainable AI (XAI)** technique (e.g., LIME, SHAP, attention mechanisms in transformers) and apply it to a small, pre-trained **Deep Learning** model (e.g., image classification for medical scans). Your **Project Portfolio** must include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase 1: Literature Review & Problem Statement:</strong> Summarize the chosen XAI technique's principles and explain its relevance to increasing trust in medical AI.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2: Implementation & Visualization:</strong> Implement the XAI technique and generate visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, feature importance plots) explaining the Deep Learning model's predictions for specific examples.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3: Critical Analysis & Ethical Implications:</strong> Critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen XAI technique, reflecting on its ethical implications in high-stakes domains like medicine, and individual reflections on challenges and **AI Agent** usage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires implementing a complex, emerging technique, interpreting its output meaningfully for a specific application, and performing critical ethical analysis. While AI can explain XAI, implementing it, debugging it, and interpreting its nuanced outputs for specific cases (especially in a high-stakes domain) demands significant human expertise and **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in both coding and domain understanding.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your team applied SHAP values. Explain a specific instance where the SHAP output for a medical image prediction seemed counterintuitive, and how you investigated the underlying data or model to understand it."</li>
                <li>"If you were to integrate your XAI solution into a clinical setting, what ethical guidelines from **AI 500** would be most relevant, and how would you address potential misinterpretations by clinicians?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Implementing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from Research Paper</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Choose a recent research paper (published within the last year, instructor-approved) detailing a novel **Generative AI** architecture (e.g., a specific GAN variant, a new VAE approach). Your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Replicate a core component of the paper's architecture (e.g., the generator or discriminator, or a specific training trick).</li>
                <li>Train the component on a small, appropriate dataset.</li>
                <li>Submit the code, a report on training stability/output quality, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to interpret complex equations from the paper, generate boilerplate code, and debug training instabilities. Include your critical evaluation of the AI's suggestions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires translating complex research paper concepts into functional code, debugging highly unstable Generative AI models, and critically evaluating **AI Agent** output against the specific details of a cutting-edge research paper. This involves advanced **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** and deep understanding of the AI's internal workings, which AI tools can assist but not fully provide.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a specific challenge you faced when using an **AI Agent** to implement a novel loss function or architectural change described in your research paper, and how your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in **Deep Learning** helped you overcome it."</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you use to ask the AI to 'explain the intuition' behind a specific mathematical formulation in your chosen research paper?"</li>
            </ul>
