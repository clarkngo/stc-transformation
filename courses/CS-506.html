        <h1>CS 506: Programming for Computing - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> A foundational course focusing on modern programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms essential for advanced computing and specialized AI/Data Science work.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Algorithm Selection for a Social Media Feed</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A new social media app needs to design the core logic for its user feed. As the lead developer, you must evaluate two different data structures to manage incoming posts: a **priority queue** (based on "likes") and a **doubly linked list** (chronological). Prepare a <strong>technical trade-off analysis (4-5 pages) and a pseudo-code implementation</strong> for both approaches. Your analysis must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze the Big O time complexity for key operations (inserting a post, retrieving the top 10 posts) for each structure.</li>
                <li>Discuss the memory usage implications of each choice.</li>
                <li>Recommend a final structure based on the app's primary goal (engagement vs. recency) and justify your decision.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires critical analysis and justification of trade-offs between two valid solutions for a specific business problem. While an AI can define data structures, it struggles to perform a nuanced comparative analysis tied to a specific product goal and defend the choice.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You chose the priority queue to maximize engagement. In a real-world scenario, how would you handle the 'starvation' problem, where new posts never get seen? What algorithmic modification would you propose?"</li>
                <li>"Walk me through the most complex part of your pseudo-code for the doubly linked list. What specific edge case did you have to account for?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Building a Small Command-Line Application (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: A Simple Inventory Management System</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team will design and build a command-line application for a small bookstore to manage its inventory. The system must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilize appropriate data structures (e.g., hash maps for book lookup, trees or lists for sorting).</li>
                <li>Support core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books.</li>
                <li>Persist data to a file (e.g., JSON or CSV).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your <strong>Project Portfolio</strong> must include the functional application, a **UML class diagram** illustrating your object-oriented design, comprehensive source code, and individual reflections on debugging challenges and your use of **AI Agents** to write boilerplate code.</p>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires translating business requirements into a coherent object-oriented design and implementing it. AI can generate snippets, but designing the overall class structure, managing state, and ensuring data persistence correctly demands human architectural thinking and debugging skills.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Explain your team's choice of a hash map versus a balanced binary tree for the primary book storage. What were the performance trade-offs?"</li>
                <li>"Describe a bug that was difficult to find. What specific **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in debugging did you use that your **AI Agent** couldn't help with?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Implementing a Custom Data Structure</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Implement a "Least Recently Used" (LRU) Cache from scratch using a combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list. Your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build the data structure with `get` and `put` methods that run in O(1) time complexity.</li>
                <li>Write a suite of unit tests to verify its correctness.</li>
                <li>Submit your implementation, the tests, and a <strong>Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection</strong> detailing how you used an **AI Agent** to understand the core algorithm, generate initial class structures, and write test cases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on implementing a non-trivial, combined data structure from first principles. The student must understand the underlying logic deeply enough to debug the interactions between the two components, a task where AI-generated code often fails subtly.</p>
