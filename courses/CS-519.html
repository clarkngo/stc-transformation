        <h1>CS 519: Cloud Computing - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Provides a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing principles, service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment models, and key cloud technologies from major providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Disaster Recovery Plan for a Hybrid Cloud Environment</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A mid-sized financial company operates a critical legacy database on-premises but uses a public cloud for its customer-facing web applications. Design a comprehensive **Disaster Recovery (DR) plan and architecture diagram** for this hybrid cloud environment, ensuring RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of 4 hours and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of 1 hour. Your proposal must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify specific cloud services (e.g., replication, backup, failover) for both the on-premise and cloud components.</li>
                <li>Outline the key steps and technologies for failover and failback procedures.</li>
                <li>Analyze the cost implications of your proposed DR solution across different cloud providers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires applying cloud principles to a specific, complex hybrid scenario with strict RTO/RPO constraints. While AI can list DR services, designing a coherent, cost-analyzed plan that integrates on-premise and cloud, and justifying specific technology choices, demands human expertise and **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in cloud architecture.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You chose [Specific Cloud Service] for database replication. Explain the trade-offs between 'active-passive' and 'active-active' DR strategies for this component, and why your choice aligns with the RPO."</li>
                <li>"What specific **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** (e.g., network configuration, firewall rules) would be most critical when testing the failover process for your web applications?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in researching different DR strategies, and what part of its output (e.g., specific service configurations) did you need to critically verify for accuracy in a hybrid environment?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Multi-Cloud Web Application Deployment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Resilient E-commerce Platform</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is tasked with designing and partially implementing a highly available and resilient e-commerce platform that leverages a **multi-cloud strategy** (e.g., deploying front-end on AWS, backend on Azure, or specific services on different clouds). The platform should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Host a simple web application (e.g., product catalog).</li>
                <li>Demonstrate failover capabilities between cloud regions or providers.</li>
                <li>Utilize containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for deployment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your <strong>Project Portfolio</strong> must include the functional application, detailed **architecture diagrams** (showing cross-cloud communication), Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts, and individual reflections on challenges and **AI Agent** usage.</p>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires hands-on integration of services across *multiple* cloud providers, which involves complex networking, security, and deployment challenges. While AI can generate IaC for a single cloud, designing, implementing, and debugging a multi-cloud solution that achieves resilience demands significant human expertise and **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in cloud engineering.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your multi-cloud design involves data synchronization between providers. What was the most significant challenge in maintaining data consistency, and what specific **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** (e.g., database administration, API integration) did your team use to address it?"</li>
                <li>"Explain a scenario where a single-cloud deployment would have been insufficient for your e-commerce platform's resilience goals, and how your multi-cloud approach specifically mitigates that risk."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Serverless API Gateway with Authentication</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Deploy a simple serverless API (e.g., a "Hello World" function) on a chosen cloud platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) and secure it using a cloud-native authentication mechanism (e.g., API Gateway custom authorizer, Azure AD). Your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement the serverless function and API endpoint.</li>
                <li>Configure the authentication mechanism.</li>
                <li>Submit the code, configuration files, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to generate code for the serverless function, authentication logic, and deployment scripts. Include your critical evaluation of the AI's suggestions for security and correctness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on practical cloud security and serverless deployment, where subtle misconfigurations can lead to significant vulnerabilities. The student must apply **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** to critically evaluate AI-generated security configurations, debug authentication flows, and ensure the API is correctly secured according to best practices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a specific instance where an **AI Agent's** suggestion for implementing authentication contained a security flaw (e.g., exposed credentials). How did your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in cloud security best practices help you identify and correct it?"</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you use to generate the initial authentication code, and how did you refine it after the first attempt to meet your security requirements?"</li>
            </ul>
