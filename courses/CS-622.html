        <h1>CS 622: Discrete Math and Algorithms for Computing - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Covers foundational discrete mathematics concepts (e.g., logic, set theory, graph theory) and advanced algorithm design and analysis, crucial for understanding complex AI and computing systems.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Resource Allocation in a Cloud AI Cluster</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> An **AI in Cloud Computing (AI 510)** system manager needs to optimize the allocation of GPU resources for various **Deep Learning** models, each with different computational requirements and deadlines. Design a mathematical model (using graph theory or dynamic programming concepts) to minimize wait times or maximize GPU utilization. Prepare a <strong>formal technical paper (6-8 pages) and a proof-of-concept visual simulation</strong> (e.g., using Python Matplotlib or JavaScript). Your paper must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearly define your objective function and constraints.</li>
                <li>Propose an algorithm to solve the allocation problem, justifying its computational complexity (Big O notation).</li>
                <li>Analyze the trade-offs of your approach under various load conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires applying abstract mathematical/algorithmic concepts to a nuanced computing problem. While AI can explain algorithms, it struggles with generating novel, optimized solutions for complex, multi-constrained problems and deriving Big O analysis from first principles without explicit guidance. The visual simulation further enforces understanding.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You opted for Algorithm X. Explain a specific edge case where your chosen algorithm might perform poorly, and how a different algorithm (e.g., greedy vs. dynamic programming) might handle it differently."</li>
                <li>"What specific **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** (e.g., using a debugger, profiling code) did you use to verify the correctness and efficiency of your implemented algorithm in the simulation?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in exploring different algorithmic approaches, and what part of its output (e.g., proof steps) did you need to critically verify for mathematical rigor?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Algorithmic Solution for a Graph Problem (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Optimizing Delivery Routes for AI Agents</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is developing an autonomous delivery system using multiple **AI Agents** (AI 610) that need to navigate a dynamic city network (represented as a graph with changing traffic weights). Design and implement an algorithm to find optimal paths or manage agent assignments under real-time constraints. Your **Project Portfolio** must include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase 1: Problem Formalization & Algorithm Design:</strong> Clearly define the graph model, objective, and constraints. Design a specific algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra variant, A*, matching algorithm) with pseudocode and formal analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2: Implementation & Testing:</strong> Implement the algorithm in a chosen language and test its performance on various graph sizes and complexities.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3: Scalability Analysis & Reflection:</strong> Analyze the algorithm's scalability for large-scale cities and reflect on the algorithmic trade-offs, individual contributions, and **AI Agent** usage in debugging/optimization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires deep understanding of graph algorithms, their formal analysis, and practical implementation for a dynamic problem. AI can provide standard algorithm code, but adapting, optimizing, and formally analyzing a solution for a novel, dynamic constraint set (e.g., changing traffic weights) demands human expertise.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your algorithm is a modification of [Standard Algorithm]. Explain how your modification addresses the specific 'dynamic traffic' constraint, and why a purely standard approach would fail."</li>
                <li>"Given a specific graph structure, what is the tightest upper bound on the time complexity of your algorithm, and how would you prove it?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Formal Proof & Algorithm Implementation</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Given a problem related to set theory or combinatorics (e.g., counting unique permutations under specific constraints), your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write a formal mathematical proof for a specific property of the problem.</li>
                <li>Implement an algorithm to compute the solution.</li>
                <li>Submit the proof, code, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to explore proof strategies, generate code, and verify mathematical claims. Include your critical evaluation of the AI's output and any corrections you made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on the student's ability to construct formal mathematical proofs (where AI often 'hallucinates' logical steps) and critically verify complex claims. The AI acts as a brainstorming partner, but the rigor and validation are human responsibilities.</p>

        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a moment when an **AI Agent's** mathematical proof or algorithmic suggestion contained a subtle error. How did your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in discrete math or debugging help you pinpoint and correct it?"</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you find most effective for asking the AI to 'critique' its own generated proof or code for errors?"</li>
