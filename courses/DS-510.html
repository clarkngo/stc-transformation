        <h1>DS 510: Artificial Intelligence for Data Science - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Explores how AI concepts and techniques are applied within the data science workflow, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and deployment.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Customer Churn Prediction for a Local ISP</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A small, local internet service provider (ISP) is experiencing unexpected customer churn. Using a provided anonymized dataset (specific to a hypothetical local ISP, e.g., 'San Diego FiberNet'), analyze customer behavior to predict churn. Prepare a <strong>data science report (8-10 pages) and a set of key insights slides</strong> for the ISP's marketing team. Your report must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detail your data exploration and feature engineering process.</li>
                <li>Compare at least two **Machine Learning** models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), justifying your choice of metrics and model selection.</li>
                <li>Translate your findings into actionable recommendations for reducing churn, specifically tailored to the local ISP's challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires applying data science principles to a specific, unique dataset with contextualized business recommendations. While AI can build models, the critical thinking for feature engineering on a novel dataset, justifying model choices with domain context, and generating *actionable, specific* business insights remains human-driven.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You engineered Feature X from the raw data. Explain the business intuition behind this feature's importance, and what specific **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** (e.g., SQL querying, Python data manipulation) you used to create it."</li>
                <li>"Your chosen model achieved an accuracy of Y. What are its limitations regarding interpretability, and how might that affect the marketing team's trust in your recommendations?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in drafting the initial data science report, and what specific analytical interpretations did you have to critically verify from its output?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: End-to-End AI/ML Pipeline for Data Analysis (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Predictive Maintenance System</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is tasked with building a full-stack, data-driven system to predict equipment failure (e.g., HVAC systems in campus buildings, local manufacturing line components) using sensor data. The system should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ingest streaming sensor data (simulated).</li>
                <li>Train a **Machine Learning** model (e.g., time-series prediction) to detect anomalies or predict failures.</li>
                <li>Provide a simple dashboard (e.g., using Streamlit, Dash) to visualize predictions and model confidence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your <strong>Project Portfolio</strong> must include the functional system, detailed **architecture diagrams** (showing data flow, model serving), comprehensive code, and individual reflections on challenges and **AI Agent** usage in development.</p>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires integrating multiple components (data ingestion, ML model, visualization) into a cohesive system, which involves complex architectural decisions and debugging. While AI can provide code for individual components, the integration and overall system design require human oversight and problem-solving.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your system uses [Specific ML Model] for predictive maintenance. Explain how your team managed potential data drift in the sensor readings, and what **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** were critical for monitoring data quality."</li>
                <li>"If your model frequently produced false positives, what steps would your team take to debug the model, and how would you iterate on your **Prompt Engineering** to get better debugging insights from an **AI Agent**?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Advanced Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Given a raw, messy dataset (e.g., customer transaction logs, sensor readings with missing values and outliers), your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perform comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and advanced feature engineering using Python libraries.</li>
                <li>Justify each step with statistical or domain-specific reasoning.</li>
                <li>Submit the processed dataset, the Python script, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to explore different preprocessing techniques, generate code for transformations, and identify potential issues in the raw data. Include your critical evaluation of the AI's suggestions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on the often-messy, iterative process of real-world data preprocessing, where human judgment is paramount. While AI can suggest code, the student must apply **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** to detect subtle issues in the data and critically evaluate if AI's transformations are appropriate for the specific dataset and downstream **Machine Learning** task.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Share an instance where an **AI Agent's** suggestion for handling missing values in your dataset was inappropriate, and how your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** helped you identify a more suitable method."</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you use to ask the AI to suggest 'advanced' feature engineering techniques, and which ones did you find most effective for your dataset?"</li>
            </ul>
