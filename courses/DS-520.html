        <h1>DS 520: Data Mining - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Explores core data mining techniques for pattern discovery, association rule learning, clustering, classification, and anomaly detection. Emphasizes real-world application and interpretation of results.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A regional bank needs to enhance its fraud detection system for credit card transactions. Using a provided (simulated and anonymized) transaction dataset that includes known fraudulent activities, design a data mining pipeline. Prepare a <strong>technical report (7-9 pages) and a visualization dashboard (e.g., Tableau, Power BI mock-up)</strong> for the bank's risk management team. Your report must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Justify your choice of data mining techniques (e.g., anomaly detection, classification algorithms) for this specific problem.</li>
                <li>Detail your feature engineering strategy and handling of imbalanced data.</li>
                <li>Analyze the trade-offs between precision and recall in this high-stakes context.</li>
                <li>Translate your findings into actionable recommendations for improving fraud detection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires applying complex data mining techniques to a high-stakes, real-world problem with nuanced performance considerations (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives in fraud). While AI can generate code for models, the critical judgment in feature engineering, metric selection, and translating results into *actionable, risk-aware* business recommendations is human-driven.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"You chose [Specific Data Mining Technique]. Explain a specific limitation of this technique in detecting novel fraud patterns, and what **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** (e.g., feature selection, outlier detection) were crucial in preparing your data for it."</li>
                <li>"In the context of fraud detection, which is more critical: high precision or high recall, and how would your model's performance impact the bank's customers and bottom line?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in exploring different data mining algorithms for fraud detection, and what part of its output (e.g., assumptions, limitations) did you critically verify for relevance to financial data?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Building an Intelligent Recommendation System (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Hyper-Personalized Book Recommendations</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is tasked with building a book recommendation system for a small, independent online bookstore. The system should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilize historical user-book interaction data (provided, or publicly available).</li>
                <li>Implement at least two distinct data mining approaches (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, association rule mining).</li>
                <li>Provide a demonstrable API endpoint that returns recommendations for a given user or book.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your <strong>Project Portfolio</strong> must include the functional system, detailed **architecture diagrams** (showing data flow, model serving), comprehensive code, and individual reflections on challenges and **AI Agent** usage.</p>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires implementing and integrating complex data mining algorithms, managing diverse data, and evaluating performance in a specific application (recommendation). While AI can generate code for individual algorithms, the architectural design, integration, and critical comparison of different data mining approaches for a specific business goal demand human expertise and **Hands-On Skills (HOS)**.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your system uses [Specific Recommendation Algorithm]. What was the most challenging aspect of handling 'cold start' users/items (new users with no history), and how did your team address it using specific data mining concepts?"</li>
                <li>"Explain the trade-offs your team considered between accuracy and diversity in your recommendations, and how that impacts the user experience for a small bookstore."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Implementing and Optimizing a Clustering Algorithm</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Given a dataset of customer demographics, your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) from a Python library to segment customers.</li>
                <li>Experiment with different parameter settings (e.g., number of clusters, epsilon for DBSCAN) and evaluate the quality of the clusters using appropriate metrics (e.g., Silhouette score).</li>
                <li>Interpret the characteristics of the discovered clusters to describe distinct customer segments.</li>
                <li>Submit the code, a report on cluster characteristics, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to explore clustering algorithms, generate code, and interpret cluster profiles. Include your critical evaluation of the AI's suggestions and any corrections you made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?** Focuses on the iterative process of applying and optimizing data mining algorithms, where human judgment is critical for parameter tuning and interpreting results. While AI can generate code, the student must apply **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in data visualization and domain knowledge to discern meaningful clusters and justify their findings.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a specific instance where an **AI Agent's** suggestion for the number of clusters led to poor results, and how your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** (e.g., elbow method, domain knowledge) helped you choose a better parameter."</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you use to ask the AI to 'characterize the differences' between your discovered customer segments, and how did you refine its output with your own domain understanding?"</li>
            </ul>
