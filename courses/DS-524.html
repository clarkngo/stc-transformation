        <h1>DS 524: Data Management and Governance - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Focuses on principles and practices for effective data management, including database systems, data warehousing, data quality, security, and governance policies in an organizational context.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: GDPR Compliance for a Healthcare App</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A startup developing a mobile health application for tracking personal fitness and medication adherence plans to launch in Europe. This app collects highly sensitive personal and health data. As a Data Governance Lead, prepare a <strong>comprehensive Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) report (8-10 pages) and a data flow diagram</strong> illustrating how data will be managed from collection to deletion. Your report must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify specific GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) articles relevant to data collection, processing, storage, and user rights for this app.</li>
                <li>Propose concrete technical and organizational measures (e.g., encryption, access controls, consent mechanisms) to ensure compliance.</li>
                <li>Analyze potential risks and propose mitigation strategies for data breaches and non-compliance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires synthesizing legal/regulatory frameworks (GDPR) with specific data management practices for a sensitive domain. While AI can summarize GDPR articles, applying them to a detailed app scenario, designing compliant data flows, and proposing specific technical mitigation strategies demands human expertise in **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** for data security and privacy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your data flow diagram shows data encrypted 'at rest' and 'in transit.' What specific **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** would a database administrator need to implement and verify these encryption measures?"</li>
                <li>"Explain the 'right to be forgotten' under GDPR. How does your proposed data management system technically support this right for users of the health app?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in exploring different data anonymization techniques, and what part of its output (e.g., differential privacy implementations) did you critically verify for effectiveness and compliance?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Designing a Data Governance Framework (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Data Governance for a University's Research Data</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is advising the **STC** on developing a comprehensive data governance framework for all research data generated by its faculty and students. This data includes potentially sensitive human subject data, proprietary algorithms, and publicly available datasets. Your <strong>Project Portfolio</strong> must include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase 1: Policy Development:</strong> Draft key data governance policies covering data ownership, access, quality, security, and retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2: Architectural Recommendation:</strong> Propose a technical architecture for a data catalog, metadata management, and secure data storage solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3: Implementation Strategy & Reflection:</strong> Outline a phased implementation plan for the framework, considering organizational change management, and individual reflections on challenges and **AI Agent** usage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires the design of a holistic framework, integrating policy with technical architecture for a complex organizational context (university research). While AI can generate policy templates or list technologies, the critical synthesis of policy, architecture, and implementation strategy tailored to specific organizational needs demands significant human expertise in data management and governance **Hands-On Skills (HOS)**.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your policy defines 'data owner.' In the context of student research data, who would typically be the data owner, and what **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** would they need to fulfill their responsibilities?"</li>
                <li>"Explain a potential conflict between the 'open science' ethos of a university and the need for data security/privacy, and how your framework balances these competing demands."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Data Quality & Profiling Automation</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Given a dataset with known quality issues (e.g., missing values, duplicates, out-of-range values, inconsistent formats), your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write Python code to automatically profile the dataset (identify data types, missingness, unique values, distributions).</li>
                <li>Implement a set of data quality rules (e.g., 'age must be >0 and <120', 'email must be valid format') and code to flag or clean violations.</li>
                <li>Submit the profiling report, the cleaning script, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to generate profiling code, suggest data quality rules, and debug cleaning scripts. Include your critical evaluation of the AI's suggestions and any corrections you made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on the practical, often tedious, but critical task of data quality. While AI can generate profiling code, the human must apply **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in data analysis to define meaningful quality rules, interpret profiling results critically, and debug complex cleaning logic, especially for nuanced domain-specific rules.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a specific instance where an **AI Agent's** suggestion for a data quality rule was too simplistic or too aggressive, and how your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in understanding data distributions helped you refine it."</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you use to ask the AI to generate a 'comprehensive set of data quality rules' for your dataset, and which of its suggestions did you find most useful/least useful?"</li>
            </ul>
