        <h1>DS 623: Math & Statistics for Data Science - Proposed Assessments</h1>
        <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Provides a foundational understanding of the mathematical and statistical principles underpinning data science, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** algorithms.</p>

        <h2>1. Applied Case Studies / Conceptual Assessment (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Statistical Power Analysis for an A/B Test</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> A company is planning an A/B test for a new website feature and needs to determine the required sample size to detect a 2% improvement in conversion rate with 80% power at a 5% significance level. Prepare a <strong>formal statistical report (5-7 pages, including derivations) and a Jupyter Notebook</strong> demonstrating the calculations. Your report must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearly state all assumptions and justify your choice of statistical tests.</li>
                <li>Derive the formula for sample size calculation for this specific scenario.</li>
                <li>Discuss the implications of Type I and Type II errors in this business context.</li>
                <li>Analyze how the required sample size changes with different effect sizes and power levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires formal mathematical derivation and statistical reasoning applied to a specific scenario, going beyond simple formula lookup. While AI can perform calculations or provide formulas, critical justification of assumptions, error type implications, and multi-scenario analysis demand human statistical expertise and **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in statistical programming.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"In your derivation, what specific mathematical step ensures that you control for Type I error, and what are the real-world consequences if that step is flawed?"</li>
                <li>"Your Jupyter Notebook uses [specific library]. What **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** were essential for you to correctly interpret its output regarding statistical power, beyond just reading the numbers?"</li>
                <li>"How might an **AI Agent** assist you in exploring different statistical tests for this A/B test, and what part of its output (e.g., assumptions for each test) did you critically verify?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Team Project: Mathematical Foundations of a Machine Learning Algorithm (40%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Deconstructing PCA</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Your team is assigned a core **Machine Learning** algorithm (e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machines (SVM) kernel trick, K-Means clustering optimization). Your task is to fully deconstruct its mathematical foundations. Your <strong>Project Portfolio</strong> must include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase 1: Formal Derivation:</strong> Provide a complete, step-by-step mathematical derivation of the algorithm from first principles (e.g., for PCA, derive eigenvalues/eigenvectors from variance maximization).</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2: Intuitive Explanation & Visualizations:</strong> Create an intuitive, visual explanation (e.g., using Python plots, interactive web app) of the algorithm's core mathematical concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3: Implementation from Scratch & Analysis:</strong> Implement the core algorithm from scratch (without relying on high-level ML libraries) and analyze its performance against standard library implementations on a small dataset.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Requires deep mathematical understanding for formal derivation and implementation from scratch, which AIs often struggle to do rigorously or without "hallucinations." The visual explanation and comparison against library implementations also demand a human's pedagogical insight and **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in numerical programming.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example Viva Questions (Post-Submission)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Your derivation of [specific part of algorithm] is crucial. Walk me through the most challenging mathematical step, and why a common shortcut might lead to an incorrect understanding."</li>
                <li>"When implementing PCA from scratch, what specific **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in linear algebra (e.g., matrix operations) were critical, and how did you verify the correctness of your low-level implementation?"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Programming Exercises (PE) (20%)</h2>
        <h3>Example Scenario: Numerical Optimization of a Loss Function</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Given a complex, non-convex loss function and a dataset, your task is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement a numerical optimization algorithm (e.g., Gradient Descent, Newton's method) to find its minimum.</li>
                <li>Experiment with different learning rates and initialization strategies.</li>
                <li>Submit the code, a convergence plot, and a **Prompt Engineering Log & Reflection** detailing your use of **AI Agents** to derive gradients, explore optimization techniques, and debug numerical stability issues. Include your critical evaluation of the AI's suggestions and any corrections you made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why AI-Resistant?</strong> Focuses on the practical challenges of numerical optimization, where AI can help but often provides suboptimal or unstable solutions without careful human guidance. The student must apply mathematical **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** to correctly compute gradients and debug numerical errors.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example PE-Related Discussion Questions (Class Forum / Instructor Check-in)</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li>"Describe a specific instance where an **AI Agent's** suggestion for a learning rate or initialization strategy led to your optimization failing, and how your **Hands-On Skills (HOS)** in calculus helped you troubleshoot."</li>
                <li>"What prompt did you use to ask the AI to 'explain the intuition' behind a specific numerical optimization technique, and how did that help you implement it?"</li>
            </ul>
